# Refactor Calendar Utils - Consolidate and Relocate Functions

## Summary

Completed comprehensive refactoring of `utils/calendar.ts` to improve code organization by moving functions and types closer to their usage points and eliminating unnecessary abstractions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Types to Proper Location
- **Moved** `TimeSlot` and `WeekDay` interfaces from `utils/calendar.ts` to `types/calendar.ts`
- **Reason**: Types belong in the types folder alongside other FHIR types
- **Impact**: Better type organization following existing project structure

### 2. Eliminated Custom Utility Functions
- **Deleted** `formatTime()` → Replaced with native `toLocaleTimeString()`
- **Deleted** `formatDateForApi()` → Replaced with native `setHours()` + `toISOString()`
- **Deleted** `parseTimeSlot()` → Removed unused function
- **Reason**: Eliminated unnecessary abstractions over native JavaScript APIs
- **Impact**: Reduced code complexity, improved maintainability

### 3. Moved Component-Specific Functions
- **Moved** `getCurrentTimePosition()` from utils to `CalendarGrid.tsx` as local function
- **Moved** `generateTimeSlots()` from utils to `CalendarGrid.tsx` as local function  
- **Moved** `getSlotId()` from utils to `CalendarGrid.tsx` as local function
- **Reason**: These functions are UI-specific and only used in CalendarGrid
- **Impact**: Better separation of concerns, functions live where they're used

### 4. Moved Business Constants
- **Moved** `WORK_START_HOUR`, `WORK_END_HOUR`, `SLOT_DURATION_MINUTES` to `CalendarGrid.tsx`
- **Reason**: Only used in CalendarGrid component
- **Impact**: Reduced utils file complexity

### 5. Calendar Navigation Helpers
- **Moved** `getLocalDayStart()`, `getLocalDayEnd()`, `getPreviousWeek()`, `getNextWeek()` from utils to `Calendar.tsx` as local functions
- **Reason**: Single-use helpers specific to Calendar component navigation
- **Impact**: Component-specific logic lives with the component

## Final State

### Before
- `utils/calendar.ts`: 11 functions + 2 interfaces + 3 constants (large, mixed-purpose file)

### After  
- `utils/calendar.ts`: 1 function (`getWeekDays()` - genuinely shared utility)
- `types/calendar.ts`: 2 interfaces (proper type organization)
- Component functions: Moved to their respective components as local functions
- Constants: Moved to the component that uses them

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Better code organization** - Functions moved to where they're actually used
- ✅ **Improved type organization** - Types in dedicated folder following project patterns
- ✅ **Reduced abstraction** - Eliminated custom utilities over native JavaScript APIs
- ✅ **Better separation of concerns** - UI logic in components, shared utilities in utils
- ✅ **Maintained functionality** - Zero breaking changes, all features work exactly as before

## Testing

- ✅ Calendar loads properly with all time slots
- ✅ Navigation (Previous/Next week, Today) works correctly
- ✅ Appointment creation modal opens and displays correct times
- ✅ All existing appointments display properly
- ✅ Time formatting uses native JavaScript correctly

The refactoring successfully transformed a large, mixed-purpose utils file into focused, well-organized code with proper separation of concerns.
