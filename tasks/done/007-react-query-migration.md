# Task 007: React Query Migration

## Overview
Migrate the entire application from manual state management to React Query for better data fetching, caching, and state management. This was triggered by a delete bug causing infinite 410 HTTP errors.

## Requirements
- [x] Install and configure React Query
- [x] Create organized API hooks structure
- [x] Migrate PatientDetail component (fixes delete bug)
- [x] Migrate PatientEdit and PatientForm to use mutations
- [x] Fix TypeScript patterns to use proper assertions
- [x] Test all CRUD operations
- [x] Ensure build passes

## Implementation Details

### React Query Setup
- Installed `@tanstack/react-query` and devtools
- Set up QueryClient in main.tsx with proper configuration
- Added query key factory for type safety

### API Hooks Structure
- `src/hooks/api/queryKeys.ts` - Type-safe query key factory
- `src/hooks/api/usePatient.ts` - Single patient fetch hook
- `src/hooks/api/usePatientMutations.ts` - Create, update, delete mutations
- `src/hooks/api/index.ts` - Centralized exports

### Component Updates
- **PatientDetail**: Migrated from manual state to React Query, fixed 410 error loop
- **PatientEdit**: Simplified from 40+ lines to clean hook usage
- **PatientForm**: Migrated create functionality to React Query mutation

### TypeScript Improvements
- Replaced redundant null checks with proper type assertions
- Fixed import issues in ToastContext
- Resolved Patient type resourceType issue

## Bug Fixes
- **Critical**: Fixed infinite 410 HTTP errors after patient deletion
- **Build**: Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors
- **UX**: Improved error handling and loading states

## Testing
- ✅ Patient list navigation
- ✅ Patient detail page display
- ✅ Edit functionality with pre-filled forms
- ✅ Create patient workflow
- ✅ Delete functionality (no more 410 errors)
- ✅ Build passes without errors

## Next Steps
Future tasks could include:
- Migrate usePatientSearch to React Query
- Add Dashboard stats with React Query
- Performance optimizations and cleanup

## Notes
React Query completely resolved the delete bug by providing automatic cleanup and preventing state updates after component unmount. The user confirmed the implementation fixed their original issue.
